        <p>Williams is married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. He proposed to her on December 10, 2016, in Rome. On December 30, 2016, Williams announced their engagement in a Reddit post. They married on November 16, 2017, in New Orleans. Guests at the wedding included Beyoncé, Anna Wintour, Kelly Rowland and Kim Kardashian. She planned to move to San Francisco with Ohanian after the wedding.

<p>On April 19, 2017, Williams posted a sideways picture of herself on Snapchat that focused on her midsection; it had the caption, "20 weeks", prompting speculation that she was pregnant. Later that evening, her spokesperson confirmed the pregnancy. The fact that she was 20 weeks pregnant when announcing her pregnancy meant that she was eight weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open earlier that year. Williams later said that posting the picture on Snapchat was an accident, and that she had intended to save the photo for her records.</p>

<p>In September 2017, Williams gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr, who is often referred to as "Olympia".</p>

        <p>In the September 2022 issue of Vogue, written in August, Williams announced that she was "evolving away from tennis, toward other things that are important to me." In her announcement she said that she disliked the word "retirement" and preferred the term "evolution".</P>

While she did not set an exact time for her goodbye, she stated that she wasn’t ready to win Wimbledon (where she lost in the first round), but would try to win in New York. She also said that she consulted Tiger Woods in her decision.</P>
